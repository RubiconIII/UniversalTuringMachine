# Universal Turing Machine

By: Curtis P. Hohl 👨‍💻

A Turing machine is a hypothetical machine thought of by the mathematician Alan Turing in 1936. This is a universal Turing machine, or UTM.  The UTM is a Turing machine that can simulate an arbitrary Turing machine on arbitrary input.

I developed this based on my studies in a Theory of Computation course.
